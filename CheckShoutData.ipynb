Computing the power in the entire sampled signal would include the power of the noise across a relatively very large bandwidth, and would artificially increase the received power estimate.\n",

We integrate the power across a narrow band (plus or minus `approx_halfbandwidth`) around the frequency of the CW signal `sine_wfreq`. There is a tradeoff for the approx_halfbandwidth value -- too high and we'll let more noise in, and too low will eliminate some of the power from our signal. Generally, unless the SNR is very low, the noise power is small compared to the signal power, and having a wider approx_halfbandwidth doesn't affect the signal power much.\n",

Also, the units of linear power here are pretty close to mW, but we don't have calibration data for the receiver to really know the characteristics of the particular SDR, so I call this reference X mW. Thus when we convert it to decibels, I refer it to \"dBX\", that is, referred to X mW, and X is unknown.\n",
